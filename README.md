IT314-Software Engineering Lab-1  Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements


<h1>Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:</h1>

<h3><i>Functional Requirements:</h3></i>
<br>
<b>function Requirments for users:</b>

<br>
1.Members of the LIC should be able to borrow and return the book, with two options either by sitting at their desk or chamber.<br>
2.Members should be able to extend the deadline to return the book.
<br>
3.Non members of the library can be able to search and browse book online.
<br>
4.Only members of the library can be able to borrow books and return it.
<br>
<br>
<b>Function Requirments for Librarian/administration:</b>

<br>
5.There should be a system where The librarian, has administrative privileges and complete control over the system.
<br>
6.The librarian should be able to enter new records and able to delete them as well.The librarian should be able to update details of user, validate the profile of new  user etc.
<br>
7.All transactions which are done in a single day should be managed and recorded with ease.
<br>
8.The system should be created as a web application using the recent HTML 5 technology.
<br>
<br>

<h3><i>Non-Functional Requirements:</h3></i>
<br>
1.The system should only run within the institute LAN, which reduces the security risks of the software.
<br>
2.There should be some encryption data such as passwords and some sensitive information.
<br>
3.User can create/apply for becoming members of the library through system.
<br>
<br>

<h1>Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.</h1>
<br>
<h3><i>Scope:</h3></i>
<br>
There are 466 million people around the world who suffer from the disabling hearing loss,the scope is to create a mobile application that addresses this problem which aims to make positive impact on this people.
<br>
<br>
<h3><i>Feature:</h3></i>
<br>
1.artificial intelligence:  The application uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies.
<br>
2.Immediate alerts: the app provides real time alerts to the users when such kind of sounds recognize, so user can respond to the sound at the same time.
<br>
3.Optimized for low-latency real time use: this app is optimized for android with  low-latency use with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.
<br>
<br>

<h3><i>Non-functional aspects:</h3></i>
1.Performance: The app should have real time processing capacity and low latency for android use.
<br>
2.Usability: The app should have user friendly interface and comfortable for user (who has this disability) to easily use.
<br>
3.Reliability : our AI model should be accurate to recognize every sound and it should be consistent as well,which ensures user safety.
<br>
4.Security: Our app should be secure enough to protect users' data which build trust in our app.
